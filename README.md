Title: 
The Impact of Player Participation on National Team Success in Football

Team members: 
Ahmad, Modris

Research Question:
How do the popularity of a sport and the number of players influence a country's long-term success in national tournaments?

Hypothesis:
The long-term success of national football teams correlates with the number of players participating in the sport within the country.

Data source:
Transfermarket World ranking 2025
World Population Review
Football Talent Pool that has been collected independently per country 

Methology:
colonarity 
OLG Analysis
Case Study

Description: 
The project examines how the popularity of football and the number of active players influence a country's long-term success in international tournaments. By analyzing national team performances, we aim to determine whether a larger player base correlates with sustained competitive success. Our research focuses on FIFA rankings as an objective measure of long-term success, considering data on player participation and football's popularity within different nations. We aim to find a business solution for India to improve its popularity.

Analysis:
We have found that there is a moderate negative correlation (-031) between the Rank of a country and its talent pool. The OLS analysis shows an R-square 0.102, which means our dependent variable (talent pool) can not define our independent variable (Rank) alone. We concluded that there might be other factors that in reality determine the Rank and overall progress of a country in the football world.
